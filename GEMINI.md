## Gemini-Specific Notes

- If code is adjusted, generated, or altered by Gemini, the class must include a Javadoc `@author` tag: `@author Co-authored-by: Google Gemini using <model name>`
- If an AI co-authorship `@author` tag already exists for a different model or AI, it must be preserved, and a new `@author` tag for the current AI and model must be added.
- Commits generated by AI automation should include: `Co-authored-by: Google Gemini using <model name>`
