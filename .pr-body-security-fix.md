## Problem

Two unit tests were failing on Java 21+ because SecurityManager was completely removed in Java 21:
- `ReportSystemEnvironmentSecurityExceptionTest`
- `ReportSystemPropertiesSecurityExceptionTest`

These tests verify that the Report classes handle SecurityException properly when accessing system properties or environment variables.

## Solution

Implemented a dual-mode testing approach that works across all Java versions:

### Java 8-20
- Uses the original SecurityManager approach
- Sets a custom SecurityManager that throws SecurityException
- Tests the actual security mechanism

### Java 21+
- Uses Mockito spy to simulate SecurityException
- Added protected methods `getSystemProperties()` and `getEnvironmentVariables()` to enable mocking
- Throws SecurityException via `doThrow()` when these methods are called

### Implementation Details

1. Added `getSystemProperties()` protected method to `ReportSystemProperties` class
2. Modified both test classes to detect Java version at runtime
3. Conditional setUp/tearDown based on Java version
4. Same assertions execute regardless of approach used
5. Tests now pass on all Java versions (8-21+)

## Testing

All 1441 tests pass on Java 21:
```
Tests run: 1441, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0
```

## Related

This fix is independent of the Mockito upgrade in PR #17 but uses the same Mockito 5.7.0 version for Java 21 compatibility.
