# This workflow builds, tests, and analyzes the project.
# It runs on pushes and pull requests to the main branch,
# and on pushes to feature branches (only for code changes).
# Tests are executed against both SLF4J 1.7.x and 2.0.x to ensure compatibility across LTS JDK versions.
#
# Strategy:
# 1. Build once with JDK 21 + SLF4J 2.0 (generates JAR that works with both SLF4J 1.7 and 2.0)
# 2. Run tests on all JDK/SLF4J combinations using the compiled artifact
#    Note: slf4j-toys has multiple surefire executions (unit-tests + logback-tests),
#    both are tested with each JDK/SLF4J combination
