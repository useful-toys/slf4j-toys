## Copilot-Specific Notes

- If code is adjusted, generated, or altered by Copilot, the class must include a Javadoc `@author` tag: `@author Co-authored-by: GitHub Copilot using <model name>`
- If an AI co-authorship `@author` tag already exists for a different model or AI, it must be preserved, and a new `@author` tag for the current AI and model must be added.
- Commits generated by AI automation should include: `Co-authored-by: GitHub Copilot using <model name>`

## Terminal Instructions
  - Use the terminal directly to run commands.
  - Never create a sub-shell (e.g., do not use `powershell -c "..."`, `cmd /c "..."`) 
    to ensure environment variables (like `JAVA_HOME`) and terminal state are preserved.
  - Do not start new terminal sessions.
  - On powershell terminal, use powershell syntax and commands 
    (e.g., `Get-ChildItem`, `Select-Object`, pipes with `|`; not cmd.exe or bash syntax).
